// non linear data structure used for storing data
// made up of nodes and edges without having any cycle 
// each node in a tree can point to n number of nodes in a tree
// parent node called root and many levels of additional nodes
// node with no children (pointing to any other nodes) are called leaf nodes.

/* Binary tree if each node has 0, 1 or 2 children
TreeNode is:
